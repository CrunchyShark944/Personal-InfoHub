# Personal InfoHub

A personal dashboard

## Proposal

The goal of this project is to provide a usable tool set that makes your life a little bit easier (hopefully), rather than to achieve a clich√© imitation as many other school projects I did in my previous academic career.

Personal InfoHub is a personal dashboard that collects the information I check daily. For example: weather, stock price, package tracking, and etc.. I would like to integrate as many tools as possible if I find something is meaningful to be added, and if time permits.

This project is likely to be an individual project. Therefore, I don't think my project will be complicated in terms of coding. However, this doesn't mean I will not enforce the DevOps way of software developing.

#### The general image I got so far

Everyone is able to register an account to save their settings.

A user is able to add a zipcode to its favorite places to check weather.

A user is able to add a stock code to its watchlist to check stock price for the day.

A user is able to add a tracking number to its waitlist to check item location and expected delivery date.

...

Low Priority: the service is able to safely deployed on the public internet and free from basic attacks.
